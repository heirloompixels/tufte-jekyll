Digital ruminations. 
Collections. 
Thoughts. 
Theories, both sound or otherwise. 
Whispers. 
Contemplations and conundrums.  Misunderstandings a sublime synchronicity. 

{% newthought 'The collected (condensed) works' %} of Kyle Cunningham, painter and desert dweller.  Printmaker and purveyor of handcrafted adornment. Notes and rumination upon various subjects pertaining and not pertaining to his own creations.  This is a collection of established quips and visual cues accompanied.{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' 'This is not a normal website, not in the portfolio sense.  Rather it is an art project of its own, my portfolio forming a foundation of the contents of this creation.  Itâ€™s not a blog or a scrapbook but rather a book in the metaphorical sense.  A collection of my thoughts, creations, motivations, ideas, desires and actions in life.'%}
